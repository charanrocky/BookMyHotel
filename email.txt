Hi Junior Developer's,

Thank you for submitting your recent pull request (PR). I appreciate the effort you put into the changes; however, after reviewing the PR, Iâ€™ve identified a few issues that need to be addressed before it can be merged.

ðŸš¨ Reasons for Rejection:
Code Consistency â€“ The coding style is not aligned with our projectâ€™s guidelines. For instance, the indentation and use of camelCase for variable names should match the existing format.
Missing Error Handling â€“ The API call in BookingService.js is not wrapped in a try-catch block, which could cause the application to crash in case of a failed request.
Incomplete Unit Tests â€“ The new RoomAvailability component lacks test coverage. We require at least 80% test coverage for new components.
Hardcoded Values â€“ There are some hardcoded URLs in the config.js file that should be moved to environment variables.
ðŸ’¡ Suggested Improvements:
âœ… Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations to maintain code consistency.
âœ… Wrap all async functions in try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully.
âœ… Add unit tests using Jest for the new component to meet the test coverage requirement.
âœ… Replace hardcoded values with environment variables (use process.env).

Please make these adjustments and submit the updated PR. If you need any help or clarification, feel free to reach out â€” Iâ€™m happy to walk you through any of the changes!

Thank you for your hard work â€” once these issues are addressed, Iâ€™m confident your PR will be ready to merge.
